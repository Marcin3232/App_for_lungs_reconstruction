# App_for_lungs_reconstruction
The aim of the project is to reconstruct the 3D lung tree from cross-sectional photos of the chest, using the Matlab environment and image processing methods such as image segmentation. It is required that the photos are the same size and arranged in descending order in relation to the name.
