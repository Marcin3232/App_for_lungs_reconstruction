# App_for_lungs_reconstruction
The aim of the project is to reconstruct the 3D lung tree from cross-sectional photos of the chest, using the Matlab environment and image processing methods such as image segmentation. It is required that the photos are the same size and arranged in descending order in relation to the name.

# Application Examples
# Introducing
Image segmentation is an essential part of the image processing process. It enables the analysis of parts - objects extracted from the image. Segmentation is the process of dividing an image into coherent areas homogeneous in terms of a certain criterion, which are related to the objects in the image. The criterion can be:
- intensity
- intensity gradient
- color
- characteristic textures

The result of segmentation is the image of identifiers, where each object is assigned a different identifier, while all points belonging to one object have the same identifier. Identifiers are often consecutive natural numbers. However, this rule loses its relevance in the case of binarization.

## Image segmentation methods
The literature on image processing is extensive, so segmentation techniques available tens occur. Some of them are:
